Lung Volume Estimation from HRCT Images
Overview
This project aims to develop a method for estimating lung volumes from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scans. The approach involves image preprocessing, lung segmentation, and volume calculation based on pixel/voxel data. This non-invasive technique has potential applications in medical diagnostics and pulmonary health monitoring.

Literature Review

Estimating lung volume using High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) is a well-explored area with significant clinical importance. Several studies have demonstrated that volumetric analysis of lung tissue from CT images can provide valuable insights into pulmonary health, complementing traditional pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
Automated Lung Volumetry:
Studies such as Gevenois et al. (2003) and subsequent research have developed automated methods to segment lungs and calculate volumes from CT scans. These methods utilize thresholding and morphological operations but often struggle with accurately segmenting diseased or fibrotic lung tissue.
Deep Learning Approaches:
Recent advances involve convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially U-Net architectures, to improve segmentation accuracy. These models learn complex lung structures and variations, providing more robust segmentation in diverse clinical scenarios.
Volume Calculation Accuracy:
Accuracy in volume estimation depends on precise segmentation and accounting for voxel dimensions. Some works incorporate 3D reconstruction techniques to improve volume measurements and compensate for image distortions or variable slice thickness.
Clinical Applications:
HRCT-derived lung volumes are used for assessing diseases such as emphysema, fibrosis, and pneumonia. Automated and accurate lung volume estimation supports diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and treatment planning.

Challenges:
Despite progress, challenges remain in handling image artifacts, variable scanning protocols, and anatomical variations across patients, motivating ongoing research to improve robustness and generalizability.
